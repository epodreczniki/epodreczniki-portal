        <h2>Welcome to the Technology Platform www.epodreczniki.pl</h2>

        <p><code>www.epodreczniki.pl</code>is a modern open
            source educational MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platform to create and share e-books on the principle
            of full
            disclosure for K12 (all digital content included in e-books will be available on-line under the free
            Creative
            Commons BY/SA licenses).</p>

        <p> E-books distributed on the platform will include text, audio, video, interactive
            quiz and on-line educational applications and provide an optimal viewing experience thanks to modern
            interfaces
            following responsive web design rules. </p>

        <p> Additionally, 2,500 objects of teaching resources will be created by
            2015 to support teachers using new e-books from 13,000 primary schools, 7,000 secondary schools and 6,000
            colleges
            in Poland. However, we are happy to work with external users and adapting the existing platform to local
            language
            and culture in the target market. </p>

        <p> In a nutshell, the platform will support the following key features:
        <ul>
            <li>Flexibility - the ability to support different user modes: online and off-line (PDF, ePub and additional
                native
                mobile apps);
            </li>
            <li>Modularity - the coexistence of different versions and functions of each e-book on different devices and
                in
                different cases;
            </li>
            <li>Security of data access to the platform with built-in diagnosis tracking and audit mechanisms;</li>
            <li>Scalability & high availability thanks to the cloud-based hosting environment reacting to dynamic
                changes of
                users, resources and services available within it.
            </li>
        </ul>
